# Asterisc Technocrat Data Science Internship - Stock Price Prediction
 Welcome to my Data Science Internship project at Asterisc Technocrat! ðŸ“Š In this repository, you'll find my work on stock price prediction using LSTM neural networks. I've performed data preprocessing, implemented the LSTM model, and evaluated its performance.
Key Highlights:

Data preprocessing scripts
LSTM model implementation
Model training and evaluation
Visualization of model results
# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

This repository is part of my internship program at Asterisc Technocrat and focuses on building a stock price prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.

## Overview

Stock price prediction is a crucial task in financial markets. Accurate predictions can provide valuable insights to traders and investors. In this project, I have implemented an LSTM-based model to forecast future stock prices based on historical price data.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains sample data and scripts for data preprocessing.
- `models/`: Includes the LSTM model implementation and training scripts.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for detailed project walkthrough and experimentation.
- `visualizations/`: Stores visualization images, such as model performance plots.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python and the required packages. You can install the dependencies using pip:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preparation: Prepare your historical stock price data in a CSV format with columns like 'Date,' 'Open,' 'High,' 'Low,' 'Close,' 'Adj Close,' and 'Volume.'

Data Preprocessing: Use the provided data preprocessing scripts or customize them to suit your dataset.

Training: Train the LSTM model using the training script. Adjust hyperparameters and model architecture as needed.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model on test data and analyze the results.
Visualization: Visualize the model's performance using the provided scripts or create your visualizations.
Data
Sample historical stock price data can be found in the data/ directory. Replace this data with your own dataset for custom predictions.

Model
The LSTM model for stock price prediction can be found in the models/ directory. Feel free to modify the model architecture and hyperparameters for experimentation.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to this project, please fork the repository and submit pull requests.

Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to the team at Asterisc Technocrat for providing me with the opportunity to work on this exciting project during my internship.
